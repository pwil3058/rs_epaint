# rs_epaint
Rust library for coloured paint

This code was translated from Python and is a bit of a mess.  The same functionality is now available in the rs_apaint repository which was written in
Rust from the ground up. It also has the advantage that the non GUI code and GUI code are in separate crates making it easier to use a different toolkit
should you so wish. Consequently this repository has been ARCHIVED.
